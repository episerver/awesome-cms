## Code Snippets

* Remove UI components for some editors [blog](https://www.david-tec.com/2016/05/remove-episerver-ui-components-for-certain-editors/). Limited UI targeting specific group of editors.
* Thumbnail for image properties [blog](https://tedgustaf.com/blog/2016/display-thumbnail-for-image-properties-in-episerver/). Replace the default editor for image properties in Episerver to display a thumbnail of the selected image.

* Visually compare page versions with markup [blog](https://gregwiechec.com/2015/11/compare-page-versions-with-markup/). It allows editor to visually check the differences between two pages. The compare page versions with markup view is similar to previous solution, but instead of comparing data on property level, whole HTML is compared.
