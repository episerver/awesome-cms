## Reference Architecture

Foundation offers a starting point that is intuitive, well-structured and modular allowing developers to select Episerver products as projects to include or exclude from their solution.

* [AlloyDemoKit](https://github.com/episerver/AlloyDemoKit)

A version of the Alloy reference site containing additional features for demoing purposes. This is not intended to be a starter solution but provides the ability to showcase a number of features and add-ons that may be needed for a demo.

## Code Snippets

* Remove UI components for some editors [blog](https://www.david-tec.com/2016/05/remove-episerver-ui-components-for-certain-editors/). Limited UI targeting specific group of editors.
* Thumbnail for image properties [blog](https://tedgustaf.com/blog/2016/display-thumbnail-for-image-properties-in-episerver/). Replace the default editor for image properties in Episerver to display a thumbnail of the selected image.

* Visually compare page versions with markup [blog](https://gregwiechec.com/2015/11/compare-page-versions-with-markup/). It allows editor to visually check the differences between two pages. The compare page versions with markup view is similar to previous solution, but instead of comparing data on property level, whole HTML is compared.
